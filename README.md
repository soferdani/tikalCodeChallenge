# Pro Camp Challenge

This repo is my implementation of completing a very cool challenge I got from a company.
I had to use star wars API to find :
1. Which vehicle names have the highest sum of the population for all its pilots’ home planets
2. Create a bar chart that compares the home planets’ own population, without using any charts libraries


Feel free to ask me anything about this challenge.
